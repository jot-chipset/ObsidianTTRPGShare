Basic canvas character sheet for two characters. If you add additional characters, you will need to right click each card in the canvas, swap file to the Stats note for the new character, then right click the card again and "Narrow to Block" and select the data (not the header) that you want to appear in the card. This is already done on the two existing sheets, so any changes to the canvas or the Stats note will automatically appear.

Install and enabled the "Advanced Tables" community plugin to get the tables to work. The screenshot shows how the character sheet for Abibaal will look once the the plugin is enabled.

NOTE: Go to settings -> core plugins -> canvas and change "Display card label" to on hover to hide the references on each card in the canvas (they are hidden in the screenshot).

Adjust the size of the canvas as you see fit. Change the background by selecting it then choosing the background icon. You will only be able to use an image you have added to the vault as a background.

Try the "Dice Roller" community plugin for rolls.
